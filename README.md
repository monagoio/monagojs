SDK for monago platform, help developers to create and consume apis without managing the fullcode and its infrastructure

**Note**: This library is only meant for usage from server-side with Monago secret API key.
For PCI compliance to be maintained, tokenization of apis url info should be done on client side with monago dashboard.

## Usage

First, you need to install the library

```bash
$ npm install @monagoio/monagojs
```
or

```bash
$ yarn add @monagoio/monagojs
```

Then, you create a project through Monago dashboard to get a **secretKey** to grant the access for the client application.

```js
import { MonagoClient } from '@monagoio/monagojs'

const client = new MonagoClient({
  secretKey: "*******"
})
```

## How to Use
There are basic usages for developers to leverage Monago SDK such as register, login, create, read, update, delete. Remember, define you model and data through Monago dashboard. 

### Example

#### Register 
To use **register** function, you can pass your data such as below.

``` js
client.register({ email: "monago@example.com", name : "monago", password: "pass" })

```

#### Login 
To use **login** function, you can pass your data such as below.

``` js
client.login({ email : "monago", password: "pass" })

```

#### Create 
To use **create** function, you can pass your data such as below.

``` js
client.post({ url: "/todos", data: {
    "name": "Build an app",
    "description": "Awesome apps ready to be released",
    "date": "2022-05-18T08:51:52.031Z"
}})

```

``` js

    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "orderby": "date"

```

}})

```
